/**
 * Scatter a ray with some probabilities according to the material properties.
 * For example, a diffuse surface scatters in a cosine-weighted hemisphere.
 * A perfect specular surface scatters in the reflected ray direction.
 * In order to apply multiple effects to one surface, probabilistically choose
 * between them.
 * 
 * The visual effect you want is to straight-up add the diffuse and specular
 * components. You can do this in a few ways. This logic also applies to
 * combining other types of materias (such as refractive).
 * 
 * - Always take an even (50/50) split between a each effect (a diffuse bounce
 *   and a specular bounce), but divide the resulting color of either branch
 *   by its probability (0.5), to counteract the chance (0.5) of the branch
 *   being taken.
 *   - This way is inefficient, but serves as a good starting point - it
 *     converges slowly, especially for pure-diffuse or pure-specular.
 * - Pick the split based on the intensity of each material color, and divide
 *   branch result by that branch's probability (whatever probability you use).
 *
 * This method applies its changes to the Ray parameter `ray` in place.
 * It also modifies the color `color` of the ray in place.
 *
 * You may need to change the parameter list for your purposes!
